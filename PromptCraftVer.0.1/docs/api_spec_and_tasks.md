## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
The 'app/__init__.py' file is responsible for initializing the Flask application and its extensions, including the SQLAlchemy database and the LoginManager.

The 'app/models.py' file defines the User, Document, and Commit models for the SQLAlchemy database. The User model includes a method for checking the user's password.

The 'app/routes.py' file defines the routes for the Flask application, including routes for user registration, login, and document management.

The 'app/forms.py' file defines the forms for user registration and login using the Flask-WTF extension.

The 'main.py' file is the main entry point for the Flask application and is responsible for running the application.
